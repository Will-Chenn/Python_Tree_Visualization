"""Assignment 2 - Tests

=== Module Description ===
This module contains sample tests for Assignment 2, Tasks 1 and 2.
Note that the data set here is a pretty small one, but should be enough to
give you an idea of how we could test your code.

NOTES:
    - If using PyCharm, go into your Settings window, and go to
      Editor -> General.
      Make sure the "Ensure line feed at file end on Save" is NOT checked.
      Then, make sure none of the example files have a blank line at the end.
      (If they do, the data size will be off.)

    - os.listdir behaves differently on different
      operating systems, so these tests have been updated
      to work on the *Teaching Lab machines*.
      Please do your testing there - otherwise,
      you might get inaccurate test failures!
