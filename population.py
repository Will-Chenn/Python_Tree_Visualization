"""Assignment 2: Modelling Population Data

=== Module Description ===
This module contains a new class, PopulationTree, which is used to model
population data drawn from the World Bank.
Even though this data has a fixed hierarchical structure (only three levels:
world, region, and country), because we are able to model it using an
AbstractTree subclass, we can then run it through our treemap visualisation
tool to get a nice interactive graphical representation of this data.

Recommended steps:
1. Read through all docstrings in this file once. There's a lot to take in,
   so don't feel like you need to understand it all the first time.
   It may be helpful to draw a small diagram of how all the helper functions
   fit together - we've provided most of the structure for you already.
2. Complete the helpers _get_population_data and _get_region_data.
   Both of these can be completed without recursion or any use of trees
   at all: they are simply exercises in taking some complex JSON data,
   and extracting the necessary information from them.
3. Review the PopulationTree constructor docstring. Note that when the first
   parameter is set to False, this behaves exactly the same as the
   AbstractTree constructor.
4. Complete _load_data. Use the PopulationTree constructor, but you should
   only need to pass in False for the first argument (this allows you to
   create the region and country nodes directly, without trying to access
   the World Bank file again).
